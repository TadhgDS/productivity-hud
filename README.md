-Radio-
Some radio shows I like to listen to, but never remember. I want the program to alert me 
when the show is starting, and give me an easy way to start listening, eg. type "yes" to
 a 'Do you want to listen to x?' question.

Be able to arrange a timetable for each day. Generated from a template with date specific
tasks added. 

-Articles-
Be able to extract articles of interest from multiple sources, eg. Robert Fisk articles, 
articles in simple french, articles as gaeilge from faoinse.ie
